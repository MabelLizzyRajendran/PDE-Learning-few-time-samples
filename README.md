# PDE-Learning-few-time-samples

## Description
This is the code used from our equation learning methodology presented in "Learning Equations from Biological Data with Limited Time Samples" by John T. Nardini, John H. Lagergren, Andrea Hawkins-Daarud, Lee Curtin, Bethan Morris, Erica M. Rutter, Kristin R. Swanson, and Kevin B. Flores. If you click on "Data Denoising/", you will be taken to the code for data denoising, and if you click on "PDE Inference/", you will be taken to the code for Equation learning. All datasets and created surface data described in the manuscript has already been uploaded to both of these files.

An example tutorial for using the PDE-Find code provided herein is provided in "PDE Inference/PDEFind Example.ipynb." Code was run using python 3.7.3.

If you have any questions or concerns, please email John T. Nardini at jtnardin@ncsu.edu.
